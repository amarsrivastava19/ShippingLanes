ShippingLanes
===================================

**ShippingLanes** is an ultra-lightweight Python extension which can calculate routes on major US highway networks. 

This tool is primarily meant for supply chain analysts and industrial engineers working in Python environments. "NodePaths" allow analysts to index transportation behavior - even when working with tens of thousands of unique lanes. "CoordinatePaths", another element of a shipping lane, can also be used to generate realistic plots of transportation networks. 

The performance of ShippingLanes is benchmarked against premium map providers like GoogleMaps - it aims to match calculated driving distances within 2% of the true value. With a performance benchmark of 2ms per calculated route, it aims to be a happy middle ground between as-the-crow-flies analysis and premium transportation optimization software - especially over large amounts of shipping data.
