This tool is ideal for supply chain analysts and industrial engineers working within Python environments, offering a fast, accurate alternative to premium mapping services.

ShippingLanes is benchmarked against providers like Google Maps, aiming to match calculated driving distances within 5% of actual values. It performs particularly well on long routes with low radii of curvature, closely aligning with benchmark distances.

With a performance benchmark of just 2ms per route calculation, ShippingLanes strikes a balance between basic "as-the-crow-flies" analysis and high-end transportation optimization software. This makes it ideal for users needing custom or specialized analysis on large volumes of shipping data.
